# Contributors

After reading README.MD to make sure you understand the website, if you have some suggestions or security fortification for the website, we would love to take a look at it.

Please clone the development branch to your own repository, make the changes, and then open a pull request to our 'development' branch.
(Contributions to the production 'master' branch will be denied without further question or appeal, and be asked to resubmit to the 'development' branch.)

We will, at our earliest convenience, review the pull request and if found (to be safe and) beneficial, we will include it in development and move it to production in due time.

You will also be given a shoutout in either/or the README, a live page on the website, or the source code Wiki. (Haven't chosen where to put that yet.)

## In Closing

Thanks for checking everything out and we hope your contributions will be of use to many others as well.
