### A Quick History of the Council

As a little bit of history, the Student Council started as an advocacy group; as a body that would simply voice the student's opinions to the faculty. Although the Student Council has since grown from that role, I hope that every member remembers that we at PEAK are without a doubt a minority at the University of Tokyo, and it is important that the Student Council does not forget its origins of being a voice for PEAK students.

\[- As retold by the previous president during 2017-2018, _Chiwu Ishido Kim_\]

### Mission Statement

We aim to represent all PEAK students through their courses, events, and their future endeavors. We will work to inspire new events and traditions, both curriculum and outside the classroom - through the challenges we are presented with - within the confines of ethics, the Law, and the students we are representing.

To accomplish this, we work with many professors, administrative offices, other clubs on campuses, and even (at times) take on inspiration from the other schools around the world in which some of our officers study-abroad.
