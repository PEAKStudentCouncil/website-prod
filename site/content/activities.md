### Introduction

As mentioned in our home page, the council's two main activities are the yearbook and the Komabasai festival. While these are our main activities, we do meet once per month, so usually there are a few other activities happening in parallel.

Meeting minutes are redacted and released on this website.

### PEAK Parents / Orientation

In past years, this has changed a few times but the general idea is some number of second year students will be assigned as 'guardians' to first year students. Usually, events such as a scavenger hunt around the campus to get the students acclimated, a pizza party / picnic (usually depends on the weather), and one or two other trips in the Tokyo area are planned by the PEAK parents.

### Student-Staff Meetings

The counterpart to our own meetings, and what inspired the Student Council to exist five years ago. When these first began a bit before this, many students would show up and bring up their wish / complaint / feedback / compliment in a disjoint and disorganized fashion - leading to a lot of unsureness and 

The Council has since been responsible for collecting feedback from their peers each month (both concretely with a seldom-used online form) and in softer-methods such as asking peers what they think of \[issue\] or sometimes as bluntly as asking 'hey, if you would talk to your professors or the Director of PEAK what would you say?*'_._ We will usually discuss what we heard at the previous meetings, add in our own internal issues, and then present them to the various professors and administrative staff who attend the meeting.

Occasionally, a dorm (most PEAK students live in the Komaba International Lodge nearby campus for at least the first two years) Resident Assistant (RA) will bring up their issues at this meeting as well. As there is usually at least one RA on the Council, their issues are sometimes fused with the Council report.

It is something _we are working on_ but the student-staff meeting is meant to be open to everyone and it is a good way to keep tabs on our activity - most everything we can say there will be said. We encourage all students who read this to attend - pay attention to your email, and you will know what date the meetings are held on. 

However, we recognize that this means that some students may wish to bring their concerns as well, so we usually try to open as much time as possible for each individual student (and sometimes staff from other faculties) visitor enough time to communicate their thoughts. 

\*Yes, this has previously led to us receiving accolades and thank you messages for professors, which we do pass-on during these meetings.

### Yearbook

This has changed quite recently. Until mid-2018, the UTokyo yearbook did not recognize the existence of PEAK, (nor did it find any centralized person who would respond to their occasional inquiries), hence no PEAK students were featured in the yearbook. During these years, some of our Council members talented in graphic arts (and usually a few people outside of the main Council) were brought together in the Council's Yearbook Team (CYT). A period from March(ish) to July is used to design and publish the book before the graduating seniors leave the University.

In addition, beginning this year the Council acts as the interface to schedule the group and individual photos for the UTokyo yearbook. Currently, we plan to continue producing both yearbooks in parallel - a move which I (the writer in early 2019) assume will be evaluated for its efficacy in a couple of years.

### Komabasai Festival

The annual Komabasai Festival is always held in the last weekend of November in each year. The festival for 2019 upcoming will be the 70th annual Komaba festival year. The Student Council takes approximately four months to plan for this two-or-three day event. Somewhere in June or July (outside this 4-month window), usually a reminder is added to the Council meeting to begin work on the Komabasai applications when they come out. 4-8 people are added to the Komabasai Core Operations team (KCO), which usually begins operations in October. 

At this stage, it is still a quick webform, but failure to apply by mid-August means we have no Komabasai. Then, in late September is the first representatives meeting. This is the only meeting where both representatives must attend, as it has not even yet been decided which council member will be head and which will be the vice-head. 

After this meeting, the online web-system for Komabasai activities, _Almighty_ is started. The above head/vice-head decision is made, and internally within the Council, the two representatives take back their information to the other 2-6 council members in the KCO. A meeting is convened, and initial ideas are given. These ideas are then passed by in the late-September / early-October staff-meetings and monthly Council meeting. October is spent focusing on the logistics of the fundraising activity for Komabasai. 

The second representatives meeting (RM) is held in late-October and by then, we will need to have the finances prepared for a 1-2 week window for paying the deposit and rental dues. Starting this RM, only one person need attend and substitutes from KCO are allowable. The third RM happens just prior to the festival, where some last minute advice and changes are given - this is also the KCO's cue to finalize the volunteer schedule. \[Naturally, the festival is what follows this.\] 

After the festival, there is a reflection at the Council and staff/student meetings - so we can discuss both good events and the odd issue or two. As we enter December, there is a fourth Komabasai RM to recap, discuss who committed rule violations, and return deposit money. Not long after this, quick messages are sent to all volunteers and the KCO to thank them for their hard work and service, thus concluding four (arguably six) months of planning for the Komaba festival.

It is the counterpart to the Hongo Campus May Festival, which will have its 91st annual festival this upcoming year. We currently have no plans to participate.
