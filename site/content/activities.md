### Introduction

As mentioned in our home page, the council's two main activities are the yearbook and the Komabasai festival. While these are our main activities, we do meet once per month, so usually there are a few other activities happening in parallel.

Meeting minutes are redacted and released on this website.

### Komabasai Festival

The annual Komabasai Festival is always held in the last weekend of November in each year. The festival for 2019 upcoming will be the 70th annual Komaba festival year. The Student Council takes approximately four months to plan for this two-or-three day event. Somewhere in June or July (outside this 4-month window), usually a reminder is added to the Council meeting to begin work on the Komabasai applications when they come out. 4-8 people are added to the Komabasai Core Operations team (KCO), which usually begins operations in October. 

At this stage, it is still a quick webform, but failure to apply by mid-August means we have no Komabasai. Then, in late September is the first representatives meeting. This is the only meeting where both representatives must attend, as it has not even yet been decided which council member will be head and which will be the vice-head. 

After this meeting, the online web-system for Komabasai activities, _Almighty_ is started. The above head/vice-head decision is made, and internally within the Council, the two representatives take back their information to the other 2-6 council members in the KCO. A meeting is convened, and initial ideas are given. These ideas are then passed by in the late-September / early-October staff-meetings and monthly Council meeting. October is spent focusing on the logistics of the fundraising activity for Komabasai. 

The second representatives meeting (RM) is held in late-October and by then, we will need to have the finances prepared for a 1-2 week window for paying the deposit and rental dues. Starting this RM, only one person need attend and substitutes from KCO are allowable. The third RM happens just prior to the festival, where some last minute advice and changes are given - this is also the KCO's cue to finalize the volunteer schedule. \[Naturally, the festival is what follows this.\] 

After the festival, there is a reflection at the Council and staff/student meetings - so we can discuss both good events and the odd issue or two. As we enter December, there is a fourth Komabasai RM to recap, discuss who committed rule violations, and return deposit money. Not long after this, quick messages are sent to all volunteers and the KCO to thank them for their hard work and service, thus concluding four (arguably six) months of planning for the Komaba festival.

It is the counterpart to the Hongo Campus May Festival, which will have its 91st annual festival this upcoming year. We currently have no plans to participate.
