The meeting minutes are to be released externally as a public-facing Google group.

This will allow maximum efficiency, as the posting of the minutes can be conducted by simply writing an email to the group address and requests for comments (RFCs) and other responses to the ideas presented in the condensed minutes can be sent in by email.

The [group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/peakstudentcouncil "group") can be viewed with the link provided*, and you may write-in by sending an email to [peakstudentcouncil@googlegroups.com](mailto:peakstudentcouncil@googlegroups.com).

\*Please click on the underlined 'group' in this sentence.

A separate, but interesting project also on Google Groups, is our sister organization PEAK Textbook's visual comparison tool which sends an alert post when a change is detected on the Junior (and/or) Senior Divisions' webpages.

Their groups can be viewed at the following links:  
[Junior Division](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/utokyo-jdnews)  
[Senior Division](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/utokyo-sdnews)

â€»At some point, this webpage will be updated to include inline frames of the Google Groups served directly on this webpage, instead of asking users to click on links to reach the Google Groups. We apologize for the current inconveniences, and will be working towards fixing this issue ASAP.
