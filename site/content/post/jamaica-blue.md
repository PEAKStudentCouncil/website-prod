## A little history

Traditionally, PEAK Student Council did not have an established method for obtaining new members. The Council started around five years ago, as an organized method for PEAK students to communicate feedback to the professors and to ask for organized support behind student activities. 

> The council is only around five years old, and only recently enacted an organized recruitment system.

The first active recruitment (where members were actively added into the council) was three years ago (early 2016). At the time, it was a quick Facebook post and everyone meeting in the dorm's common room. This continued for a few years until last year (early 2018) when it was decided that we would hold interviews as we received more applications than we had available positions. 

## So, Interviews?

Yes, it could be called that.

On the Student Council side, we first asked prospective members to fill in an online survey form. We called an application period of two weeks, and the form itself was rather simple - name, school year level, and  program (purely demographics). We saved the question about what position you would like (if known) for the interview, expecting that students would not be yet aware of the different functions and positions in the council.

The interview itself was conducted by two senior members (over one year serving the council) and one junior member (less than one year) during the previous application cycle. We will not guarantee that this balance or total number of interviewers is preserved, but the interview will continue to be held as a panel interview. While the questions themselves may change, you should expect to speak about previous leadership experiences and/or why you wish to represent your peers in PEAK.

Of note, not _everything_ we do is a protest to counter the current initiatives of the program. In fact, _only the smallest portion of our activities_ (see Overview page) might fall in this category - so please keep this in mind while you apply.
