## What are these meetings

It is a private (but not anonymous) way for students to voice concerns, and to hear the professors' and administrators' view of how the PEAK program is run.

In the past the following suggestions have come from these meetings

\- At least two distinct Japanese course restructuring

\- Adjustment in the rigour of the JEA International Relations course.

\- Mathematics tutorials for PEAK Students in English

\- Increased hiring of science-oriented GO Tutors

\- Discussion on the institution of a system of prerequisite courses (currently shelved)

## Why you should attend

The meetings are open for any interested student or faculty to attend. It is a great forum to hear what is going on in your program, understand the view of professors on the ways they run their classes, and even to just meet up with a professor you have not seen in a long while. They are open door, so you can come in and leave (with or without your lunch, but we suggest you bring yours) freely.



There is no need to give a comment if you don't wish to, please relax and listen to the others. Or, if you are interested in speaking, then please ask your comment or question at this meeting!
