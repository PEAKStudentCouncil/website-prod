description: Our first PEAK booth at Komabasai festival was a big success. We turned
  a profit on our fried potatoes and our T-shirt fundraiser, while also informing
  the community members (including other UTokyo students and agents of the media)
  about what our program is about.

This year, from Nov 23rd-25th, marked the 69th annual UTokyo - Komaba campus school festival. It was also our first-ever Kombasai in the eight years of the PEAK program, and it did not disappoint.

We sold over 500 units of 'tornado potato' - a treat resembling a crispy, fried potato on a kebab stick - while chatting with our customers about what our major program is about. We even made friends with some community members - from a group of kindergartners to other clubs at the University.

## Reflection for Future Years

First off, perhaps is the following notes that may be useful for reflection for the future years

1. Avoid any violations. Keep reading the rules book.
2. Don't skip on being careful during transport of items. / Have at least 2x bikes and 1x cart.
3. .Fundraise for Komabasai early - while future years will have a budget, the event is an expensive one.
4. .Never underestimate your popularity with customers, lest you lose any by keeping a line too long. Yet, keep a _small_ line so it shows a good appearance.
5. Always have fun. It's much easier to serve customers with a smile over a frown.

## Other things that happened

In no particular order

1. The UTokyo Newspaper took a photo of us and Fuji TV's _Sanam Equation of UTokyo_ interviewed some of our members.
2. A couple of us helped the Komabasai committee to sort the trash.
3. A very dedicated art time spent many hours creating the booth's board design.
4. The name started with an internal meeting's suggestion to have some members practice yoga as a performance near the stand. Taking after our internationalism, another member suggested the pun 'World of potatoes' (in Japanese, 'yo/ga-po/ta/to') which somehow** unanimously stuck.
5. We fundraised a very large amount of money, more through the PEAK T-shirts that we designed as a fundraiser for this event, rather than the actual sales* of potatoes on the day of.

\*We still made a profit.  
\**Neither member has any clue why this may be, but it works.
